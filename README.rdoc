Demonstration of a simple app that shows the problem with RailsPanel/meta_request.

If meta_request is not enabled in the Gemfile, then you can use the Chrome Dev Tools.

If meta_request and RailsPanel are installed, when Chrome Dev Tools are used,
then BetterErrors won't show data in the right hand panel and the companion gem
BindingOfCaller, also fails - no pane, no REPL.

Tested on Nitrous, using Ruby 1.9.3 p547.
